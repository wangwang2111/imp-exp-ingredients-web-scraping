# Web Scraping for Exporting and Importing data of ingredients (from China)

This project uses Selenium to scrape importing/exporting data from the customs - website link: https://vip.lsmaps.com/Trade/VNMExp / https://vip.lsmaps.com/Trade/VNMImp. This can take the customized input as followed:

 - search_options ("importer", "HScode", "exporter", "ingredients")
 - EXPORT_DATA (True or False)
 - UNDOWNLOADED_CHATS as a list of importers/exporters/HScode/ingredients

This is done monthly for the market research in my previous company
